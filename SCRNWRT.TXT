* General Concepts:
* LINLST - an array of addresses of
*    all the lines in the document.
*    The first entry is a word of 
*    memory containing the total number
*    of lines. Every other entry is a
*    word representing the the address
*    of a string comprising one line.
* FMTLST - an array of data describing
*    the character formats of text in
*    the document. Each entry is four
*    words long. The first word is the
*    index of the line in LINLST. The
*    third byte is the index of the 
*    character in the line. The fourth
*    byte describes bold, italic, 
*    underline, superscript, subscript,
*    and characters per inch.
* MGNLST - an array of data descrbing
*    margins at various points in the
*    document. SCRNWRT only cares about
*    the indent of first line and 
*    hanging indent. All margins are
*    unsigned accept first line indent.
*    Each entry is 6 bytes long. The
*    first word is a line index. The
*    third byte is the left margin. The
*    fourth byte is the right margin.
*    The fifth byte is the top/bottom
*    margin. The sixth byte is the
*    first line indent.

*
* GETLIN

*
