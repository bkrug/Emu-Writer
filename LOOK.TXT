* Methods that look backwards or
* forwards by an arbitrary number of
* document lines. Given a paragraph and
* paragraph-line, the routines can
* determine which paragraph and
* paragraph-line is a given number of
* document-lines earlier or later.

*
* Look backwards by a given number
* of document-lines.
*
* Input:
* R0 contains the original paragraph
*    index.
* R1 contains the original
*    paragraph-line index.
* R2 contains the number of
*    document-lines to move.
* Output:
* R0 contains the earlier paragraph
*    index.
* R1 contains the earlier paragraph-
*    line index.
